Embedding the Unity game engine into .NET MAUI.

What is Unity? What is UAAL? What is MAUI?

## Why?

Using 3D techs in MAUI would require writing engine from scratch.

With this way we can use Unity:

 * Use of full fledged 3D engine.
 * Use of x-plat augmented reality features.

Unity has limitations so using MAUI is useful:

 * Unity is constrained to .NET 4.5 (very, very old -> 2012!!!)
 * With Unity, must use its own UI frameworks and cannot access platform UI features. This makes it hard, cumbersome to build modern UIs. Highly specialist skill-set to hire for.
 * Unity is deeply restricted when using 3rd party vendors (EG: Auth0 for identity)
 * 

Therefore combining these two techs means we can get the best of both worlds:

 * One of the industry leaders in games/3D techs.
